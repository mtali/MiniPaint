# MiniPaint
A simple android application that uses the concept of custom view to draw 2D graphic paths
You can look for more guide on [Kotlin Advanced Codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/advanced-android-kotlin-training/) 

## Fundamental concepts covered
To draw something you need four basic components
- Bitmap
- Canvas
- Drawing primitive:- i.e. rect, path, text, bitmap
- Paint:- describe color styles etc

## Additional concept(s)
Dithering 
> Full-color photographs may contain an almost infinite range of color values. Dithering is the most common means of reducing the color range of images down to the 256 (or fewer) colors seen in 8-bit GIF images.
